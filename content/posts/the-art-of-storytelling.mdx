Users. Customers. Buyers. Shoppers. Clients. Patrons. Consumers. We use many different names to describe the people for whom we build things on the web, but we often forget that they are just that -- people. People with emotions, contrasting opinions, differing reactions and distinct expectations.

People don't get excited about websites. People aren't excited by a fancy interface or an expensive font. People get excited about _experiences_.

And this is why I became a designer. I love the look on my client's face when I present a project for the first time, and totally knock it out of the park. I love seeing a group of users excitedly exploring a new version of a product they have used for years. The more I put into this job, the more I get out of it.

Everything put on the web tells a story. The challenge is to write a story that your customers will want to tell over and over again.
