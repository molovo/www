Lack of confidence is not a curse. It's a problem; a thing to be overcome.

I've spent my entire life solving problems, but I can't seem to break this one. And I'm not alone, there's quite a few of us.

We're the ones dotted around the edge of the room at conferences, awkwardly playing with our phones, hoping to be noticed.

We're the ones who travel to meet ups, only to spend 10 minutes outside chain-smoking, trying to build up the confidence to enter, only to give up and leave.

I could chat for hours about what I do, if I only I could find the balls to introduce myself.

All it takes is one friendly face; one person to spot me, and I can become a normal person again.

It's a problem, that's all. I'll get there.
