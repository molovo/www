I've come a long way since I started my career. For the four years I've been writing it, this blog has served as a great reminder to myself of my progress as a designer and developer. That said, it has also contained---for a long time---posts which are naive, misinformative, pretentious and _a bit too sweary_.

Whilst I'm all for preserving the integrity of links on the internet, a lot of these past articles do not represent my current position as a designer, developer and decent human being. As such, I've removed those articles which I'm no longer proud of, and that is why you may be seeing this explanation instead of what you expected to see.

Please take a look at [the full listing](/writing) and read some of my other articles. Some of them are actually quite good.
