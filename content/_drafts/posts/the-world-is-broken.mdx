A decade sounds like a really long time when you say it out loud. When I wrote [The view from above](/writing/the-view-from-above) it was with lofty, optimistic ambitions that some day I'd change the world through my work---or at least, contribute in some way to it's betterment.

I held out hope that technological advances or online philanthropic solutions would solve global problems like poverty, hunger, climate change, all within my lifetime.

**Boy, did we ever fuck that up.**

I've watched hateful, vile people flood into parliaments, congresses and senates the world over. I've watched thousands of innocent people die of COVID because of the incompetence of a small number of politicians, and the sheer, selfish ignorance of large swathes of the public. I've seen friends and colleagues feel forced to leave my country because racist and xenophobic politicians were allowed to spread lies without any repercussions. I've watched the high court rule that it's perfectly acceptable to kill a fully grown baby because it shares genetic traits with my son (who, by the way, is the most awesome human you'll ever meet).

And the most heartbreaking thing about all of these events, is that they were made possible almost entirely through the abuse of online platforms that, to me, used to feel like _my home_. Platforms that I have watched devolve into cesspits overwhelmed with the worst examples of inhumanity.

  It's no exaggeration to say that I made a career out of oversharing on social media. In the early days of Twitter, every problem I faced, every success I had, every feeling, every absent thought was shared online. And more often than not that sparked a conversation which led to a problem solved, a success celebrated, and as time went on, the vast majority of my career opportunities. My (admittedly limited) reach as a musician would not exist if it were not for Instagram and Spotify, and the connections they enabled for me. Countless hobbies have been enriched by obscure forum posts in some tiny online community or another. Acquaintances made on the internet have gone on to become some of the most important people in my life.

  It pains me to
