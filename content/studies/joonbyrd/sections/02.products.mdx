The homepage was all about setting the tone. Big, bold visuals and clean typography, but not too clinical or cold. It had to feel approachable and intriguing, like an invitation to explore.

Each product in Joonbyrd's range has its own vibe, and so every product page a unique look, each with its own distinct design details. Inspired by the product's ingredients or benefits, different colour palettes and imagery were chosen to match the mood and story of each product. It's subtle, but impactful, and the end result is an immersive, engaging experience that feels tailored to the product.
