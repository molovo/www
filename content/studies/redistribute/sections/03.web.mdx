Redistribute's biggest feature is its content. I designed an article layout which puts it front and center, and added the ability for editors to add media and contextual asides right alongside the article.

<SyncedScroll
  images={[
    articleTwo,
    articleThree
  ]}
  caption="Some examples of article templates used on redistributemag.com"
  size="container-width"
/>

The navigation menu I designed makes it easy for readers to find content, with different article types neatly categorised.

<ContentImage
  src={nav}
  alt="The main navigation on redistributemag.com"
/>

The site is full of hand-built custom components, used for featuring articles, displaying media and promoting premium content.

<ImageWall
  images={[
    watermarkTwo,
    watermarkOne
  ]}
  stagger={false}
  layout="contain"
  style={{ gridTemplateColumns: '100%' }}
  caption="The custom icons I created are used to great effect to watermark premium and media content."
/>

As an independent magazine who want to keep advertising to a minimum, premium content is the biggest income stream for Redistribute. I built a custom membership system using Netlify Identity and Stripe Subscriptions, which is all handled on-site. A custom paywall was also built to encourage readers to become members.

<ContentImage
  src={watermarkThree}
  alt="Membership call to action component."
/>

<ContentImage
  src={paywall}
  alt="The paywall as it appears to non-members."
/>
