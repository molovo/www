Redistribute's biggest feature is its content. I designed an article layout which puts it front and center, and added the ability for editors to add media and contextual asides right alongside the article.

<SyncedScroll
  images={[
    {
      image: articleTwo,
      alt: 'A screenhot of an album review page from the Redistribute Magazine website.',
      sizes: '50vw'
    },
    {
      image: articleThree,
      alt: 'A screenshot of an interview page from the Redistribute Magazine website',
      sizes: '50vw'
    }
  ]}
  caption="Some examples of article templates used"
  size="container-width"
/>

Second to the reading experience is discoverability, allowing repeat visitors to easily find and consume the latest content. The homepage and listing pages I designed make it easy for readers to find content, with different article types neatly categorised, and the newest content pushed to the front of the pile.

<SyncedScroll
  images={[
    {
      image: homepage,
      alt: 'A screenshot of the homepage of the Redistribute Magazine website',
      sizes: '50vw'
    },
    {
      image: listing,
      alt: 'A screenshot of the reviews listing page from the Redistribute Magazine website',
      sizes: '50vw'
    }
  ]}

The site is full of hand-built custom components, used for featuring articles, displaying media and promoting premium content.

<ImageWall
  images={[
    {
      image: watermarkTwo,
      alt: 'A screenshot of a featured article block from the Redistribute Magazine website',
      sizes: '(min-width: 64em) 64em, 100vw'
    },
    {
      image: watermarkOne,
      alt: 'A screenshot of a video player from the Redistribute Magazine website',
      sizes: '(min-width: 64em) 64em, 100vw'
    }
  ]}
  stagger={false}
  layout="contain"
  style={{ gridTemplateColumns: '100%' }}

As an independent magazine who want to keep advertising to a minimum, premium content is the biggest income stream for Redistribute. I built a custom membership system using Netlify Identity and Stripe Subscriptions, which is all handled on-site. A custom paywall was also built to encourage readers to become members.

<ContentImage
  src={watermarkThree}
  alt="A screenshot of the membership call to action component from the Redistribute Magazine website"
  sizes="(min-width: 64em) 64em, 100vw"
  caption="Membership call to action component."
/>

<ContentImage
  src={paywall}
  alt="A screenshot of the paywall from the Redistribute Magazine website"
  sizes="(min-width: 64em) 64em, 100vw"
  caption="The paywall as it appears to non-members."
