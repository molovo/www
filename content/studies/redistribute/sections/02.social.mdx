To allow Redistribute to show off new articles, I created a series of templates for social media posts, to be used across Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media outlets. These templates, in square and portrait formats, make heavy use of the 'R', and make it easy to create a consistent look and feel for all posts.
