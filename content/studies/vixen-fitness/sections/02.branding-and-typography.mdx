With a name, it was time to move on and start putting together a branding package that would inform Gemma's marketing efforts.

#### 1. Logo

For the Vixen Fitness logo, I used a simple icon of a vixen, with a long, flowing curve to symbolise its tail. Used with a bold, all-caps logotype, it really nailed the balance of strength and femininity that we were looking for.

<ImageWall images={metadata.logos} stagger={false} size="container-width" caption="The Vixen Fitness logo in a variety of colorways" />

#### 2. Typography

The strong, unapologetic boldness of Montserrat was so effective as a logotype that I decided to use it as the primary font for the website and Gemma’s marketing materials. Using multiple weights meant I could strike a nice balance between huge, bold headings and a cleaner, lighter weight for more readable body copy.

<TypeSample fontName="Montserrat Bold" fontClass={montserrat.className} sourceWords={sourceWords} style={{ textTransform: 'uppercase' }} />

To counter Montserrat’s strength I used Have Heart One to add a touch of femininity to headings and other brand assets.

<TypeSample fontName="Have Heart One" fontClass="use-have-heart-one-font" sourceWords={sourceWords} style={{ fontSize: '8vw', lineHeight: '1em' }} />

#### 3. Printed materials

Gemma meets most of her clients face to face, but handing over a business card doesn’t really convey everything that she has to offer. To help her make a good impression, I designed a series of postcards to give to clients and hand out at events; each one providing more information about particular services she provides, allowing her to put the right information in front of prospective clients from the outset, and hopefully win their business.

<Slideshow images={metadata.postcards} caption="A series of postcards advertising Gemma's services" style={{ backgroundColor: '#edf2f4', paddingBlock: '3em 6.75em' }} captionStyle={{ bottom: '1.5em', top: 'auto' }} />

The rest of Gemma’s branding collateral followed a similiar theme, keeping the bold headings, bright colours and white border; a combination which formed the basis for the website design.

<ImageWall images={metadata.collateral} stagger={false} size="standard" style={{ alignItems: 'stretch' }} caption="Left: Gemma's business cards<br />Right: A series of place cards used for circuit training" />
