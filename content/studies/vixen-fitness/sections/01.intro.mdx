Gemma is a personal trainer, specialising in pre- and post-natal fitness, and using exercise as a way to boost self-esteem and body confidence. She came to me just as she was launching her new, as-yet-unnamed business, and was looking for guidance to help her get it off the ground.

Launching a brand-new business in a busy space is always a challenge, so Gemma tasked me with coming up with a name, brand and website package which would help her to stand out.

Before I could do any design work, we needed to come up with a name for this new venture. When Gemma and I sat down to discuss options, it wasn't long before we had uncovered two key points which needed to be addressed:

<ol className="case-study__feature-list">
  <li>
    Since Gemmaâ€™s client base is predominantly women, we needed something that
    was unmistakably feminine.
  </li>
  <li>
    At the same time, it needed to convey the strength and body confidence that
    her clients aspire to.
  </li>
</ol>

After throwing around a few abstract ideas, we both came to the same conclusion; The flowing form of the vixen&mdash;a well-known metaphor for female beauty&mdash;seemed like the perfect fit, and the name Vixen Fitness was born.

As well as the Vixen Fitness name, we also came up with a reusable hashtag for marketing materials, for which I created a graphic.

<p style={{ fontSize: '4.5em', fontFamily: 'Have Heart One', textAlign: 'center', margin: '.6666em 0', color: 'var(--accent-color)' }}>#beavixen</p>
